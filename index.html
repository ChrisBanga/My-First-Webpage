  <h1> My first website </h2>
  <h2> This was written with a little help from Moringa School</h2>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
  <p> Welcome to my first webpage! </p>

  <p> I hope they will more after this one.
  Let's get started.</p>
  <p> <strong> Here </strong> we'll learn to write paragraphs.</p>
  <p> <em>Apparently this tag "p" is used to make new paragraphs. </em> </p>
  <p> I cannot wait to discover what the other tags do. </p>
  <p> Also, as part of this course, I'll be learning the following languages:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>And a lot more</li>
  </ul>
