  <h1> Favorite things </h1>
  <p> The following text contains a list of some of my favorite things</p>
  <h2> Hobbies </h2>
  <p> When it comes to my favorite passtimes, my list is made up of:
    <ul>
      <li>Camping or the outdoors</li>
      <li>Reading a good book</li>
      <li>Playing football</li>
      <li>Dinner or lunch with friends</li>
    </ul>
  <h2> Foods </h2>
  <p> Being someone with a legendary appetite, asking me to pick a finite list
    of favorite is quite an ask </p>
  <p> But since you asked here it goes </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Home food! </li>
        <li>A pizza made with love  </li>
        <li>A massive bowl of spags</li>
        <li> A juicy burger </li>
        <li>And many others </li>
      </ol>
